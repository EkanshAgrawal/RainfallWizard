# RainfallWizard: Advanced Rainfall Prediction System 
Advanced Rainfall Prediction System using Logistic regression model with a gradient descent algorithm

RainfallWizard aims to predict the Weather and Atmosphere conditions using the previous dataset of weather forecasting with a focus on improving the accuracy of prediction. We can get more accurate results than the traditional methods. Our dataset consists of max and min. temperature of every day from the specific location.

# Requirements #
Make sure you have the following software installed:

● Python (version >= 3.6)
● Jupyter Notebook
● Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

# Dataset #
The dataset used for this project can be found at: Austin Weather (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grubenm/austin-weather)

# Results #
The regression models have been analyzed for rainfall prediction based on the 
rainfall dataset that is recorded by various weather stations of Austin, Texas. 
The logistic regression model is used as it provides the best accuracy of 0.75. 
The linear regression model is used as it provides the mean squared error of 
0.23 for test data.
